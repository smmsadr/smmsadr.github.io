<h1> Why AI will never replace me </h1><br />
<br />
AI is a powerful tool that can be used to automate many tasks, but there are some things that AI will never be able to do. Machine learning is great for analyzing data and finding patterns, but it cannot create original ideas or think in ways that are outside of the programmed parameters. Machines are also not able to learn and adapt to new situations like humans can, or think outside of the box.<br />
<br />
Programming is a complex task that requires creativity, ingenuity, and problem-solving skills. AI can help automate some of the more mundane tasks involved in programming, but it cannot replace the human element. Programmers must think strategically and creatively in order to develop efficient and effective solutions.<br />
